Docstring for number_guessing_game
This program is an interactive number guessing game that allows the user
to customize the number range and the number of attempts. The program
uses input validation, error handling (try/except), loops, conditional
statements, and functions to ensure the game runs smoothly without crashing.
The user is prompted to enter their name, the desired number range, and 
the number of attempts. The program then generates a random number within
the specified range and allows the user to guess the number, providing
feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game
continues until the user either guesses the number correctly or 
exhausts all attempts. After each round, the user is asked if they want to
 play again.
